# iotSwitch

This is the second slave module for the iotinator project, its purpose will be to send alerts through the iotinator framework when it detects a water leak.

For now, it's a simple stub to help create more complex slave modules, like iotSwitch, but I needed two different modules.

This one uses a class that extends the XIOTModule class.

You'll need to clone these repositories into your arduino "libraries" directory to be able to compile:

- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTModule.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTDisplay.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTConfig.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XOLEDDisplay.git 
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XEEPROMConfig.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XUtils.git


And some libraries that can be found through the Arduino IDE

TODO: list the libraries :)
